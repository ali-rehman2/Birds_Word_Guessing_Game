This is the OFFICIAL Birds Word Guessing Game in which a player would get the opportunity to guess up to 10 different birds to win the game.

The following steps provides a brief understanding of the game:
The player would first run the code regularly "import random, etc."
The player would then have the opportunity to play the game.
The rules of this game are simple:
  Guess the correct Bird by typing in the letters one-by-one.
  If the letter is correct, you will be notified that the letter is present in the guessing word.
  If the letter is incorrect, you will get a warning of 3 attempts remaining to choose the correct letter.
  After 3 attempts, the game is over and you will lose.
